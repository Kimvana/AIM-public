# AIM

Welcome to the github page of AIM! Here, you can download the newest version, request or submit changes, discuss or ask questions about the code, and more!


## Goal of the program

AIM is capable of extracting the vibrational Hamiltonian from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory. The current version allows for calculating the amide I Hamiltonian immediately, but also allows you to add your own methods (without changing the main code) to calculate other types of Hamiltonians. These vibrational Hamiltonians can be used to calculate infrared absorption (IR) spectra and 2-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectra using the [NISE](https://github.com/GHlacour/NISE_2017) code.

## Quick-start guide

### What's the difference between versions? Should I update my older version?
If you scroll further down this page, you find an overview of changes with each version. We always recommend updating!

### Where can I find the manual?
The manual can be found in the support_files folder above. It contains all information about the program, much more than this page!

### How do I download the program?
There is two ways to download AIM. You can download it directly using the git clone command in the terminal/command prompt. Alternatively, at the top of this page, there is a big green button with the text 'Code'. Click it, and select the option 'download ZIP'. Move the zip to the correct location and unzip.

### Where can I find the main executable?
The main script that should be called when running this code is called AIM.py and can be found in the folder called AIM above.

### Installing the program was a bit of work, and I've got more things to do!
Don't worry, we know! There is now an installable version of the program, where you can install (and create a very useful alias) in a single command. It lives in another branch (named installable), and we'd love you give it a try! Let us know if it worked well (and intuitively) for you, because once we're certain it does, it'll probably become the main version.

### How do I cite this work?
When using the program, please cite [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, 18, 5, 3089â€“3098](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00113). It's the paper about the AIM program itself. Please, also don't forget to cite the papers that provided the maps applied by AIM. These references are generated by AIM during runs. More information on this can be found in the FAQ in the manual.

### Is the program still being maintained?
Yes. If you find bugs or other issues, we aim (see what I did there?) to resolve those. We, however, are not currently working on adding new features.


## Contact information

If you have discovered a bug or other issue with the code, please use the [issues](https://github.com/Kimvana/AIM/issues) section. Please check if the issue is already known. If not, feel free to make a new issue! For more information on how to make the issues most helpful for us, please check the manual. 

If you have a general question/remark/suggestion, please uses the [discussions](https://github.com/Kimvana/AIM/discussions) section. If others had the same question, the answer might already be there. Otherwise, feel free to ask! Active discussions are shown automatically, answered questions can be found by setting the filter to 'closed', or 'all'.


## Links

In order to use AIM, you need to have a MD trajectory. These can be generated using MD packages. AIM is currently tested for the following MD packages (you only need one, not all):
* [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/)
* [CHARMM](https://www.charmm.org/)
* [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)
* [Amber](https://ambermd.org/)

Similarly, you need some spectral software to convert the hamiltonian trajectory to a spectrum. The format currently generated by AIM is supported by the [NISE](https://github.com/GHlacour/NISE_2017) package.

AIM requires you to have a python installation. You can get it [here](https://www.python.org/). Please make sure you get a version starting with 3.
Next to the python installation, AIM also makes use of the following modules, which have to be installed separately. Instructions for this can be found on their webpages, and are very familiar to python users: all allow using pip or conda.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)
* [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)

We'd like to encourage the growth of an engaged community. This list will feature examples of ways to extend the capabilities of AIM. Please note that the linked projects are not an official part of AIM, and we take no responsibility in maintaining, updating, or managing them.
* [This](https://github.com/lacourjansenlab/Parallel_AIM_script) is a simple way of running AIM in parallel. We hope to add parallel capabilities to AIM soon, but this should help in the meantime. 



## Changes between versions (most recent first)

### v1.0.3 (november '24)
**Main change:** bug fixes to TCC coupling model
- Both numba and C versions of the TCC calculations (selected between by (not) having a functional c library) contained small bugs, which have been resolved and verified.
- Added an 'only run on windows' condition to the declspec block at the top of the C code, so that it doesn't have to be manually (un)commented.
- Removed the occasional warning about overflows or underflows. These were of no influence to the actual results from the program, but still nice to remove the warnings.


### v1.0.2 (june '23)
**Main changes:** clearer report on missing atoms, speedup multicore applications
- Program threw odd (sometimes unpredictable) errors when using the wrong atnames file. Now, when the atnames are applied, the program checks whether all have been found, and if not, reports which. This should help inform users about what's going wrong.
- When using the parallel script provided by github user GHlacour (linked in README.md), some threads were significantly slower than others. This has now been fixed, resulting in speedups of up to a factor 4.


### v1.0.1 (may '22)
Updated the pre release to become the first official version.

**Main changes:** added license, improved documentation/feedback to user.

Additions:
- A license. Please don't forget to cite the paper when using this program!
- A reference to the paper is now printed in the 'relevant references' section.
- The option not to calculate the coupling between amide groups. Other couplings have to be managed through .cmap files.

Changes:
- The header at the beginning of the program now reflects that the paper has been released.
- The FAQ in the manual has been updated similar to the program header.


### v1.0.0 prereleases (and older)
Please see the update history file in the 'support_files' directory.
